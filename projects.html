    <h1>My Projects</h1>

    <h2>Project 1: A game of Scrabble</h2>
    <p>In this project, I created a game in Java that was to mimic Scrabble. I called it Scribble.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this project was for me to demonstrate my skills in object-oriented programming and software development.</p>
    <p>This included creating a very basic GUI to represent the board, and to create the front end and backend on my own to create an accurate simulation of the game.</p>
    <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Java, BlueJ IDE</p>

    <h2>Project 2: Social networking app</h2>
    <p>In this project, I worked within a team to implement a much larger program in Java utilizing many data structures.</p>
    <p>The purpose was to create a social media app similar to Facebook or Snapchat.</p>
    <p>My role within my team, coding-wise, was to create a system where the data could be saved by saving and loading the data to a file.</p>
    <p>As well as a sorting algorithm for the system.</p>

    <h2>Project 3: Wikipedia page</h2>
    <p>This project required me to work within a group to create a new design for a Wikipedia page called Rollercoaster Tycoon.</p>
    <p>My role was to complete the reception page, as well as make sure others were on track to complete their parts.</p>
